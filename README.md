🔥 Fire Fighting Robot
Introduction
The Fire Fighting Robot is an autonomous robotic system designed to detect and extinguish fires using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. Equipped with flame sensors, an ultrasonic sensor, and a water pump, this robot can navigate obstacles and extinguish fires efficiently.

⚙️ Features
Autonomous Fire Detection – Uses IR flame sensors to locate fire.
Obstacle Avoidance – Ultrasonic sensor prevents collisions.
Water Pump Mechanism – Sprays water in the fire's direction.
Microcontroller-Based Control – ATmega328P on Arduino Uno.
Motorized Movement – Uses L293D motor driver to control DC motors

🛠️ Components Used
Arduino Uno (ATmega328P) – Controls all operations.
L293D Motor Driver – Drives the DC motors.
Ultrasonic Sensor – Detects obstacles.
Flame Sensors – Detects fire.
5V Water Pump – Sprays water on detected fire.
Servo Motor – Controls the direction of the water spray.
Power Supply (7805 Voltage Regulator) – Provides 5V DC power.

🚀 How It Works
The flame sensors detect fire and determine its direction.
The ultrasonic sensor prevents obstacles from blocking the path.
The motor driver (L293D) moves the robot toward the fire.
The water pump activates and sprays water using a servo motor to aim.
After extinguishing the fire, the robot returns to its idle state.
